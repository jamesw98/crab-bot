# crab-bot
I wrote this bot to learn how to write bots for Discord, just a fun little day project.  
This bot does various crab related things, such as:  
- react to messages with the string "crab" in it
- post crab gifs 
- post crab facts
- react to being mentioned  
  
# Installation

2. Install `discord.py` from pip `pip install -U discord.py`
